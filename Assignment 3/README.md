This assignment was made in collaboration with: Ana Karina Ballesteros Gómez, Ángela Gómez Sacristán, Mariam El Akal Chaji, Marta Fernández González and Paula Fernández Aldama.

In the terminal type: ruby Main_Ass3.rb ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt With this you will obtain the following output files:

    1. GFF3_report.gff; The output report in gff format that has the coordinates for each CTTCTT repetition annotated in the  "local gene coordinates".

    2. GFF3_report_reex.gff; The output reexecuted report in gff format that has the coordinates for each CTTCTT repetition annotated in the "global chromosome coordinates".

    3. Report_file.txt; The output report which contains the gene id for those that weren't found any CTTCTT repetition.

In the yard folder are the outputs of using yard as a comment tool for the GFF_functions.rb generated. The file Arabidopsis_thaliana_219022374_19022379.jpeg is the GFF track beside the AT2G46340 gene on the ENSEMBL website.
