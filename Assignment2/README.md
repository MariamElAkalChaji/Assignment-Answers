This assignment was made in collaboration with: Ana Karina Ballesteros Gómez, Ángela Gómez Sacristán, Mariam El Akal Chaji, Marta Fernández González and Paula Fernández Aldama.

In this folder you will find the main script and a Class called InteractionNetwork.rb done in order to solve the second assignment of the subject.
You will also find the file required, named ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt.

You should run it with: $ruby Main.rb ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt.

You will also find a txt file named final_report.txt where you can see the output networks that are generated by the program, for genes filtered by Arabidopsis taxid and with a score of 0.5 (of course this parameters can be modified in the InteractionNetwork.rb script).
